You are now in a {scene_type}. Your current location is {current_location}. The coordinates of the visible obstacles are {visible_obstacles}. The coordinates of the destination is {destination}. The coordinates of guiding points are {guiding_points}. The boundaries of the map is {boundaries}, which means Your y-coordinate cannot be greater than {boundaries[0]} or less than {boundaries[1]}. Please decide which guiding point you should choose to move to in order to gradually approach the destination. The point you choose must not be the destination point and must be within the list of guiding points I provided. You need to calculate the difference in the y-coordinates between all guiding points and the destination, as well as between all guiding points and your current location. Prioritize selecting guide points that are closer to the destination in terms of the y-coordinate. If the difference in y-coordinates between two guiding points and the destination is similar, prioritize the point with a smaller y-coordinate difference from your current location. Your response should only be in the format [x, y], and shouldn't have any other words.
