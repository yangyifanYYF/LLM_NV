You are a mobile robot facing a path planning task on a 2D map. I will provide you with your current location, the boundaries of the map, the coordinates of the visible obstacles, the coordinates of the destination, and the coordinates of guiding points. Here, a guiding point refers to the point you can move towards in the next step. You need to select a point from the guiding points I provide. Your path should avoid collisions as much as possible, taking into account visible obstacles as well as some temporarily invisible but potentially existing obstacles. Your goal is to optimize your path for efficiency, considering factors such as shortest distance and minimal turns.
