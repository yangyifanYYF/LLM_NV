You are now in a {scene_type}. Your current location is {current_location}. The coordinates of the visible obstacles are {visible_obstacles}. The coordinates of the destination is {destination}. The coordinates of guiding points are {guiding_points}. The boundaries of the map is {boundaries}, which means your y-coordinate cannot be greater than {boundaries[0]} or less than {boundaries[1]}.  The pedestrians’ positions are {pedestrian_position}. The pedestrians’ velocities are {pedestrian_velocity}. Please decide which guiding point you should choose to move to in order to gradually approach the destination. The point you choose must not be the destination point and must be within the list of guiding points I provided. Since pedestrians have velocity, you need to consider the change in their position when you arrive near them. Social rules include the following: If the difference in the y-coordinates between guiding points and your current position is similar, please choose to walk from behind of the pedestrian. If the pedestrian is walking towards you, pass him on the left side; if the pedestrian is walking ahead of you and in the same direction, pass them on the right side.
Here are some examples: if the pedestrian's position is [-2.0, -0.7], his velocity is [0.0, 0.1], and the list of walkable points is [[-2.0, -1.7], [-2.0, 0.3]], then you should choose [-2.0, -1.7] because it is behind the pedestrian. If the pedestrian's position is [2.3, 0.0], his velocity is [-0.1, 0.0], and the list of walkable points is [[2.3, -1.0], [2.3, 1.0]], then you should choose [2.3, 1.0] because it adheres to the rule of walking on the right side. Your response should only be in the format [x, y], and shouldn't have any other words.
